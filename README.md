# FastAPI CloudWatch Logger

This tutorial uses AWS Secrets manager for managing API keys. You can use any other secure service. Also, it is assumed that you already know how to create an AWS Secret


## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll build a secure transcription Public API using FastAPI, AWS Secrets Manager, and a database (SQLite for simplicity, but it can be swapped with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or AWS RDS). The API will allow users to upload audio files for transcription while ensuring secure access using API keys.
